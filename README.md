# Triangles
Hello here. It will be my first project and so please, don't treat me much!)
At first my programm will determine basic class "Shape" with methods and fields.
For a Triangle on a plane whose vertices have a Point type, determine its type based on its sides (equilateral, isosceles, arbitrary), and type based on its angles (acute-angled, obtuse and rectangular). Also calculate the area and perimeter of the triangle.

Create an array of triangles and count the number of triangles of different types (Determine the largest and smallest triangle in area (perimeter) for each group.
